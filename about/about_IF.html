<h2>What is Ice and Fire</h2>
<p>According to Norse Mythology, before the world of man was created,two primal worlds 
existed: Niflheim, land of perpetual ice, and Muspellheim, land of fire. It was in the 
space between these worlds that creation took place and life originated.</p>
<p>Ice and Fire can, therefore, be regarded as the starting point, from which greater things 
can arise.</p>
<h2 class="fire">History of Ice and Fire</h2>
<p>Towards the end of 2002, Graham Butcher and Phillip Brough got talking on a Sunday afternoon, 
and the conversation turned to the existing structure within St&aacute;v. Specifically, the running of 
large courses, and teaching in general. </p>
<p>They realised that although there were very many skilled instructors within the St&aacute;v 
community, some of whom hold their own classes, most of the previous large courses had 
been organised by Graham (who had also produced most of the printed and published material), 
and there was no real structure in place for promoting the system beyond the people already 
involved with it. </p>
<p>What was needed, they concluded, were some people dedicated to the promotion of St&aacute;v to 
the general public, who would organise events and take care of the running of things. It 
was decided that three people would be necessary - someone to take care of actually booking 
venues, and running the course; someone to run the website, and take care of the technology 
side of things; and someone to deal with the public, take bookings, look after the visible 
side of things, etc. </p>
<p>The first two of these they could do themselves, and for the third, they called Darren 
Wells, long time friend and fellow St&aacute;v instructor. Within a couple of hours they were all 
sat around discussing how best to proceed. The decision was made to form a limited company, 
for the sole purpose of organising and running St&aacute;v events and courses, funded by a membership 
scheme which would entitle members to discounts on courses and products, etc., and so was Ice 
and Fire born. </p>
<p>In 2005, in response to a tremendous call from the US for instruction, Graham traveled to
Virginia to run the first 2 day St&aacute;v Foundation course.  Those who attended the initial Foundation 
Course have assumed the responsibility of running Ice and Fire in the US.</p>
<p>During the upcoming year, please return to this site and join Ice and Fire USA in the Expanded 
Members section, including videos covering everything from the stances to runes to healing</p>
