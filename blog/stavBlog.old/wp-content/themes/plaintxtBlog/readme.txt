INSTALLATION
For instructions and much, much more, visit http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/plaintxtblog/

VERSIONS
"plaintxtBlog 2.0" has been tested with WordPress 2.0+. This theme uses a function.php file that only works with WordPress 2.0+. plaintxtBlog 2.0 has been tested with Widgets 1.0. And it worked!

"plaintxtBlog 1.5" has been tested with WordPress 1.5 and will work with the earlier versions of WordPress. Well, probably. This is the same theme as "plaintxtBlog 2.0," but without the functions.

IMPORTANT 
I strongly suggest visiting http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/plaintxtblog/ as it is quite likely that I'll have caught some major flaw in the design. Hopefully I'll get them all. 

THANKS
I'd like to thank Raoul for permission to use his Simple Recent Comments Plugin v0.1 http://www.raoul.shacknet.nu/ in the plaintxtBlog theme. Thanks, Raoul.
