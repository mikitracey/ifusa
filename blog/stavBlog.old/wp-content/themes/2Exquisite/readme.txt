INSTALLATION:
1. Unzip file to a local folder.
2. Make any changes you need to (places where this can be done are commented).
2. FTP to the "themes" folder of your WordPress. 
3. In your WordPress admin, under "Presentation," activate theme.

EDITING:
1>To edit text written in orange block open header.php and search for that text and replace with your own.
2>To edit About Me content open index.php and search for it and edit it as per your wish.
3>By default I have added Blog name in Orange Block with h2 tag. If your blog name is too big you can remove it and declare it above menu declaration in header.php with h1 tag as shown below.
For this you just need to uncomment the line in heder.php and result declaration will be:

<div id="logo">
<h1><a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>"><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></a></h1>
</div>



Notes from Kaushal Sheth about theme and more...:

These theme is based on two themes Andreas02 ( www.oswd.org ) and Green Track (www.wpthemes.info).
I basically loved menu designed by Andreas and at the same time I liked Green Track simple yet powerful code structure.
So this design is basically a mixture of two of my favourite designs.
Image header is taken and modified from www.templatebox.com. Do visit there. That site has good quality free web templates.
Hope you like Exquisite as much as I loved Designing this theme.


DESCRIPTION:

Elegant , Proffessional , Minimal design , yes that is how I would like to describe it. Its really simple yet powerful design.
