Before you go asking me stuff, make sure you read these release notes first.

	1. This theme was made and tested for Wordpress version 2.  

	2. I am assuming that you know how to install a Wordpress theme. 
	If you don't know how, visit the Wordpress site for help:
	http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes

	3. As per the GPL License, I do not have the responsibility to provide you
	with support. So PLEASE do not feel bad if I don't reply to ALL of
	your questions. I will, however, try my best to help you through (and
	ONLY through http://filipinowebdesigner.com).

	4. Don't try to edit the theme files if you don't know what you're doing.
	You should have at least a thorough understanding of CSS and some PHP
	knowledge.

	5. If you want to change the "Author" info on the right vertical bar,
	open up sidebar.php and edit the text. I put comments on it so you'll
	know where to edit.

	6. Unlike the default theme, you can actually put text above the list of
	links in your Archive and Links page templates. Just use the Wordpress
	Page Edit in the Admin panel. Type in your text, change Page Template
	option on the right nav, save and publish.

	7. I don't like pop-ups so I didn't make a Comments pop-up layout. Don't
	ask me where it is because there really isn't any. I might make one in the
	future though, who knows? :) Right now, I don't really feel like it. Hehe.

	8. And just in case you're wondering... "Dapit Hapon" is actually the 
	Filipino term for "sunset." So yeah, this theme was inspired by none other 
	than the beautiful Philippine sunset. You should see our Manila Bay at this 
	time, such a breath-taking scene.

	9. I'm sorry for repeating myself, but there are just some people who don't
	get it without redundancy. PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR THEME CONCERNS ON MY
	PERSONAL BLOG.

	10. Have fun!


New in this version 1.1:
	
	1. Added a "nocomments" class in the CSS for protected entries. This is basically
	just a cosmetic fix. :)
