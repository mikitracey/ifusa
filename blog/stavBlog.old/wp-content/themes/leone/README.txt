	 This great theme was originally designed and built by Michael Heilemann,
             This theme could not be made without the superb work that has been done by Michael.

             The changes that have been made were done by Andiz.

             The beautiful header was made by Qays Akhtar.

	         I hope you like my theme, it's the first design that I made for WordPress. 
	         And I will be releasing more templates in the near future.
	         
	         
	         This theme is released for free, and the only thing that I would like to see is a link back to my website (http://www.amsterdamn.org) 
	         and the website of the header designer (http://www.akhtar2.deviantart.com/)
	         As you can see I already added the links in the footer,so please do not remove it. 
	         You may add other links/images/etc to the footer.
	         
	         Feel free to contact me if you've got questions regarding the theme. (see my website for my e-mail,icq etc)
	         I'd also love to hear some feedback!
	         For general support: Go to the (active) WordPress community (www.wordpress.org)
	         
	         I've also added a blank header, in case that you want to use another header --> leoneheader_blank.jpg
 	         Please note that you will have to change the name to leoneheader.jpg if you plan to use it.
	         You can also open header.php and edit the header via the code.
	         
	         If you like my work please do consider donating via Paypal on my website, thanks in anticipation!
	  

	         And last but not least: Have fun with your new theme!
