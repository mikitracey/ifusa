INSTALLATION

VERSIONS
"Barthelme v1.0" has been tested with WordPress 2.0+. This theme uses a function.php file that only works with WordPress 2.0+. Barthelme v1.0 has been tested with Widgets 1.0. And it worked!

"Barthelme OV1" is also available and will work on WordPress 1.5.x and WordPressMU. Barthelme OV1 doesn't support Widgets nor offers the theme options menu and has slim chance of ever being updated. Otherwise it's the same. 

IMPORTANT 
I strongly suggest visiting http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/barthelme/ for updates as it is quite likely that I'll have caught some major flaw in the future. Apologies. 

THANKS
I'd like to thank Rick for helping me test this theme and for his repeated attempts to break it--all for the benefit of the user. Thanks, Rick: http://www.mackrick.co.uk/. 

ABOUT DONALD BARTHELME
Besides being a personal favorite, others seem to enjoy Donald Barthelme's punchy and cerebral short stories. I have no time to pin a genre to him. He's odd, and his stories are fabulous. I've named this theme in honor of him and his story "Margins" (the first story in the book _60 Stories_). Learn more about Donald Barthelme and even read some of his stories:
