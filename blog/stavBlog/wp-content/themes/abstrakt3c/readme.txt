ABSTRAKT WORDPRESS THEME v1.0:

Notes from Kaushal Sheth about theme and more...:

This is basically a modified Wheat Grass theme and is really a proffessional Business Theme originally developed by Michael Martine http://www.michaelmartine.com/. 
I really loved it and thought would colour it according to my taste. Till now I had not made any abstract theme so thought would turn this into an Abstract theme.
Top Level Menu and Side Level Menu were added to this theme just for the purpose to ease navigation for users. After all there are many blogs in this www which just can do without menu.
Hope you like it as much as I loved redesigning this theme.


INSTALLATION:
1. Unzip file to a local folder.
2. Make any changes you need to (places where this can be done are commented).
2. FTP to the "themes" folder of your WordPress. 
3. In your WordPress admin, under "Presentation," activate theme.

NOTE ON COMMENTS:
The text of the comment policy says by default that visitor comments will appear immediately. You must have your WordPress options set so that anyone can comment and that comments are not moderated. If you want comments to be moderated, you must change your WordPress options and you need to change the text of the single.php file. Look for an HTML comment that reads: PUT YOUR COMMENT POLICY HERE. THIS IS A SAMPLE and change the text you see right below that.

NOTE ON PLACING ADS IN YOUR BLOG:
In a couple places in this theme's files, you'll see comments pointing out good places to insert Google AdSense code or other advertising code. Of course, you can put them wherever you like or are allowed to by your ad company's terms of service. These comments are merely helpful suggestions.
